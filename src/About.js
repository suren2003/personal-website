            Hi, I'm Suren! I'm a developer with experience in embedded systems
            and test automation, and I'm currently looking to transition into
            full-stack development. I love solving complex problems and creating
            solutions that work well in real-world applications. When I'm not
            coding, I stay active with sports like hockey, soccer, and
            basketball. These sports have taught me the value of teamwork, quick
            thinking, and persistenceâ€”skills that I bring into my development
            work. I thrive in environments that challenge me and am always
            excited to tackle new problems.
          </p>
